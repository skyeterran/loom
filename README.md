# ðŸ§¶ Loom: A narrative system for {your_game}
Loom is a scripting language that makes writing interactive dialogue fun! It's powered by Rust, and based on Lisp, which makes it simple to use and scalable in terms of both performance and narrative complexity.

## Features
### Writeable syntax
Loom is written like instant-message roleplaying and requires very little boilerplate, for example:
```
Loom: This is an example of dialogue!
Player: Seems pretty intuitive.
```

### Inline expressions and string formatting
Write inline expressions `(like this)` for dynamic behavior. String formatting is as simple as using `{curly_braces}` in dialogue!

### Variables
Variables can be read from and written to in dialogue:
```
Loom: What's your name?
(let player_name input)
Loom: Nice to meet you, {player_name}!
```

### Choices
Adding a player choice is as simple as calling the `choice` function in an expression:
```
Loom: Are you liking this style of writing so far?
(choice
    ("I love it!" (
        Loom: That's great to hear!
    ))
    ("Not really." (
        Loom: Aw, I'm heartbroken.
        (end)
    ))
)
```
